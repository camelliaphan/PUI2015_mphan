###Review 

1. Clarity: Overall, the graph is a little bit difficult to read. Even though each line has its own legend, the legend title is hard to understand. In addition, because the graph lacks labels on each axis, it makes it even more difficult to grasp the content of the graph. 

2. Esthetic: The graph looks quite pretty since each line has its own color. However, some colors (red, orange, yellow) look quite similar, and thus difficult to track the color of the line in the legend. 

3. Honesty: The graph well presents the data. 

4. Suggestions: add title of the graph, add more labels, change colors to more distinctive colors.
