good job on the reviews 10/10

NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
===================

the choice of plotting data instead of a histogram is esthetically appealing but largely compromises readability and causes ambiguity

the datapoints hide a pattern in the data: the age increases more significantly for women, peaking around 1980, but it is hard to tell.

the green foreground datapoints hide the background blue datapoints -> confusion and ambiguity. 

color are compliant with most color blind prescriptions

the datapoints without transparency or edges blend at the bottom. it is not a crucial problem since this plot is not meant to be read point by point however.


tick labels too small

title to verbose: that level of description belongs to the caption. title should be succinct




NOTES ON  THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
===========================================



lanimc
============

the points are green but the legend is blue.

it is not clear what the legend means: it probably means the size corresponds to the duration, but this is just an educated guess as the nothing in the legend refers to size

the color is unexplained and appears to be redundant with the size

tick labels are way too small

large values on the y axis should be substituted by a compact notation (eg using units of 1000 trips)




sv1379
============


the 3d as usual makes comparison difficult. additionally 3d bind distort the perception: we should compare differences in height but we are left with the impression given by t he difference in volumes

the color is redundant with the year 

tick labels too small

the cause of death axis labels are offset with respect to the variable

typo in the title (parenthesis close that was never open)


meo342
============

colors are nicely separable by color blind people

notation on the y axis is readable and major and minor ticks help readability but displaying a lot of info but avoiding crowdedness

the background color for the legend is distracting capturing too much attention
